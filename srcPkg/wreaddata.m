% WREADDATA Read multiple channels of data from frame files
%
% WREADDATA finds and retrieves multiple channels of time series data from a set
% of frame files.  The data are specified by the frame file type, channel name,
% start time, and duration or stop time.  The necessary frame files are located
% using a file name caching scheme.
%
% WREADDATA is build on top of the READFRAMEDATA set of high level functions
% for reading data from frame files.
%
% usage:
%
%   [data, sampleFrequencies] = ...
%     wreaddata(frameCache, channelNames, frameTypes, startTime, stopTime, ...
%               timeShifts, debugLevel);
%
%   frameCache           frame file cache structure from LOADFRAMECACHE
%   channelNames         cell array of channel names
%   frameTypes           cell array of frame types
%   startTime            gps start time of data to extract
%   stopTime             gps stop time (or duration) of data to extract
%   timeShifts           vector of time shifts [seconds]
%   debugLevel           verboseness of debug output
%
%   data                 cell array of extracted data
%   sampleFrequencies    vector of sample frequencies
%
% The data is returned as a cell array of row vectors in the same order as in
% the cell array of channel names.
%
% WREADDATA retrieves data from the requested start time up to, but not
% including, the requested stop time, such that stop minus start seconds are
% retrieved.  Alternatively, the desired duration in seconds may be specified
% instead of the GPS stop time parameter.
%
% The optional time shift argument should be a vector with one element per
% channel that specifies an additional time shift to apply to the start time for
% each detector.  By convention, a positive time shift corresponds to a delay of
% the corresponding time series.  If no time offsets are specified, a default
% time shift of zero is assumed for all detectors.
%
% To avoid the effects of round-off error, the requested start time, stop
% time, and time shifts should all be aligned with samples of the input data
% stream.
%
% If it is unable to load the requested data, WREADDATA returns empty result
% vectors and zero sample frequency for the failed channel as well as issuing a
% warning if debugLevel is set to 1 or higher.  By default, a debugLevel of
% unity is assumed.
%
% See also READFRAMEDATA, LOADFRAMECACHE, CREATEFRAMECACHE, FRGETVECT,
% WSEARCH, and WEXAMPLE.
