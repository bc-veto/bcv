% WSPECTROGRAM Display time-frequency Q transform spectrograms
%
% WSPECTROGRAM displays multi-resolution time-frequency spectrograms of
% normalized tile energy produced by WTRANSFORM.  A separate figure is produced
% for each channel and for each time-frequency plane within the requested range
% of Q values.  The resulting spectrograms are logarithmic in frequency and
% linear in time, with the tile color denoting normalized energy.

%     transforms              cell array of q transform structures

%     startTime               start time of transformed data
%     referenceTime           reference time of plot
%     timeRange               vector range of relative times to plot
%     frequencyRange          vector range of frequencies to plot
%     qRange                  scalar Q or vector range of Qs to plot
%     normalizedEnergyRange   vector range of normalized energies for colormap
%     horizontalResolution    number of data points across image
%
%     handles                 matrix of axis handles for each spectrogram
%
% The user can focus on a subset of the times and frequencies available in the
% original transform data by specifying a desired time and frequency range.
% Ranges should be specified as a two component vector, consisting of the
% minimum and maximum value.  Additionally, WSPECTROGRAM can be restricted to
% plot only a subset of the available Q planes by specifying a single Q or a
% range of Qs.  If a single Q is specified, WSPECTROGRAM displays the
% time-frequency plane which has the nearest value of Q in a logarithmic sense
% to the requested value.  If a range of Qs is specified, WSPECTROGRAM displays
% all time-frequency planes with Q values within the requested range.  By
% default all available channels, times, frequencies, and Qs are plotted.  The
% default values can be obtained for any argument by passing the empty matrix
% [].
%
% To determine the range of times to plot, WSPECTROGRAM requires the start time
% of the transformed data, a reference time, and relative time range.  Both the
% start time and reference time should be specified as absolute quantities, but
% the range of times to plot should be specified relative to the requested
% reference time.  The specified reference time is used as the time origin in
% the resulting spectrograms and is also reported in the title of each plot.
%
% If only one time-frequency plane is requested, it is plotted in the current
% figure window.  If more than one spectrogram is requested, they are plotted
% in separate figure windows starting with figure 1.
%
% The optional normalizedEnergyRange specifies the range of values to encode
% using the colormap.  By default, the lower bound is zero and the upper bound
% is autoscaled to the maximum normalized energy encountered in the specified
% range of time, frequency, and Q.
%
% The optional cell array of channel names are used to label the resulting
% figures.
%
% The optional horizontal resolution argument specifies the number data points
% in each frequency row of the displayed image.  The vector of normalized
% energies in each frequency row is then interpolated to this resolution in
% order to produce a rectangular array of data for displaying.  The vertical
% resolution is directly determined by the number of frequency rows available in
% the transform data.  By default, a horizontal resolution of 2048 data points
% is assumed, but a higher value may be necessary if the zoom feature will be
% used to magnify the image.  For aesthetic purposes, the resulting image is
% also displayed with interpolated color shading enabled.
%
% WSPECTROGRAM returns a matrix of axis handles for each spectrogram with
% each channel in a separate row and each Q plane in a separate column.
