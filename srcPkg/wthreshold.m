%
% WTHRESHOLD returns a cell array of Q transform event structures that
% contain the properties of the identified statistically significant tiles
% for each channel.  The event structure contains the following fields.
%
%   time                 center time of tile [gps seconds]
%   frequency            center frequency of tile [Hz]
%   q                    quality factor of tile []
%   duration             duration of tile [seconds]
%   bandwidth            bandwidth of tile [Hz]
%   normalizedEnergy     normalized energy of tile []
%   amplitude            signal amplitude of tile [Hz^-1/2]
%   overflowFlag         boolean overflow flag
%
% For coherent transform data, the following field is also returned.
%
%   incoherentEnergy     incoherent energy of tile []
%
% The user can focus on a subset of the times and frequencies available in
% the transform data by specifying a desired range of central times,
% central frequencies, and Qs to threshold on.  Ranges should be specified
% as a two component vector, consisting of a minimum and maximum value.
% Alternatively, if only a single Q is specified, WTHRESHOLD is only
% applied to the time-frequency plane which has the nearest value of Q in a
% logarithmic sense to the requested value.
%
% To determine the range of central times to threshold on, WTHRESHOLD
% requires the start time of the transformed data in addition to a
% reference time and a relative time range.  Both the start time and
% reference time should be specified as absolute quantities, while the
% range of times to analyze should be specified relative to the requested
% reference time.
%
% By default, WTHRESHOLD is applied to all available frequencies and Qs,
% and the reference time and relative time range arguments are set to
% exclude data potentially corrupted by filter transients as identified by
% the transient duration field of the tiling structure.  The default value
% can be obtained for any argument by passing the empty matrix [].
%
% The threshold is set to yield the specified false event rate when applied
% to all available frequencies and Qs, and is not modified to account for
% restricted ranges.  It is also only a rough estimate, and the result
% false event rate may vary significantly depending on the quality of the
% data.
%
% If provided, the optional analysisMode string is used by WTHRESHOLD to
% determine which channels are signal channels, which channels are null
% channels, and which channels to report results for.  For coherent analysis
% modes, a desired white noise veto rate, squared calibration uncertainy
% factor, and required signal correlation factor must also be specified.
%
% The optional maximumSignificants argument provides a safety mechanism to
% limit the total number of events returned by WTHRESHOLD.  If this maximum
% number of significants is exceeded, the overflow flag is set, only the
% maximumSignificants most significant tiles are returned, and a warning is
% issued if debugLevel is set to 1 or higher.  By default, maximumSignificants
% is set to infinity and debugLevel is set to unity.
