function data = wresample(data, sampleFrequencies, sampleFrequency)
% WRESAMPLE Resample time series data at a common sample frequency
%
% WRESAMPLE resamples the given time series data at the specified
% common sample frequency.  The input time series data must have the
% same length in time and the ratio of input sample frequencies must
% be expressable as a ratio of integers.
%
% usage:
%
%   resampledData = wresample(data, sampleFrequencies, sampleFrequency);
%
%   data                 cell array of input time series data
%   sampleFrequencies    vector of sample frequencies of input data [Hz]
%   sampleFrequency      desired sample frequency of resampled data [Hz]
%
%   resampledData        cell array of resampled time series data
%
% Note that any decrease in the sample frequency of a channel requires
% the application of a low pass filter to prevent aliasing at the new
% Nyquist frequency.  This filtering is performed using a zero phase
% filter to avoid introducing unwanted time delays into the resampled
% data stream.  However, filter transients are still expected at the
% beginning and end of the resample time series.  In addition, the
% resampled data stream has limited high frequency content since the
% anti-alias filter has a cutoff frequency of approximately 85 percent
% of the new Nyquist frequency.  It is up to the user to account for
% these effects.
%
% WRESAMPLE uses the Matlab RESAMPLE function in the Signal Processing
% Toolbox.
